# Final Project: Finch Robot Challenges

## Essential Question
How can we apply object-oriented programming principles and Java concepts to create interactive, autonomous robot behaviors that solve real-world challenges?

## Project Overview
In this project-based learning experience, you will program a Finch 2.0 robot to perform one of three challenges:
1. Choreograph a dance routine (with movement, lights, and sound)
2. Create an artistic drawing using the robot's movements
3. Navigate a maze autonomously

Your program must demonstrate your understanding of Java programming concepts from APCSA and object-oriented design principles while creating an engaging robot behavior.

## Learning Objectives
- Apply Java programming concepts in a physical computing context
- Implement object-oriented design principles
- Develop problem-solving skills through algorithm development
- Create well-documented and maintainable code
- Practice technical communication through presentations and documentation

## Description of design choices
What we chose to do was have our robot play a small section of a popular song, while also having it move, turn, and displayed some lights.
We also chose to make the lights different colors, and alternate between each note that played.
The robot moved back and forth and turned left and right at a moderate speed.
We chose to do this because the music selecte dwas very recognizable, and the part wasn't very long.
We also chose to have it move forward and back and turn so that it would look more like it was "dancing"
## Challenges faced and solutions
The largest challege that we faced when programming our robot were the music notes themselves.
There were two specific parts in which the same note was playing twice in a row.
Even though it technically worked, it made it sound like one note playing for a long time rather than two segmented notes.
In order to solve this, we asked Mr. Aiello for assistance. 
After doing this we developed a new file and created a new method that would allow for there to be a small pause between each note that played. 
When we implemented this, our code and music then proceeded to work as intended
## Future enhancements
The program could be futher improved if there was a means of having the robot perform the musical notes and the movements at the same time.
Additional improvements could be made in the potentially creating a single method for playing the notes and changing the light to reduce redundancy.
The robot could have also played more notes at the end or potentially played a second song.
